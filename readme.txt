Overview

This task is like a game and I hope it would be interesting. In any case, imagine a big garage. It contains vehicles. Vehicles like trucks, planes, cars, bikes etc. These vehicles have their abilities, for instance, plane can fly, boat can swim, car can switch music on. Every vehicle has to refuel, that's why every vehicle has such ability. There are several issues and we hope you'd solve them for us.
